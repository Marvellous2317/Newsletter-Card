**Learning**

In this frontend challenge, I learnt how to build a real-world UI component using HTML, CSS and JS. I used CSS Flexbox to lay out the component, make it responsive, and I used JS for form validation. 

**Features**

- The Newsletter Card Component should have an email input field for the user to enter their email address and a subscribe button.
- The email input field is validated before the user can submit the form.
- If the email address doesn't include '@', an error alert message will be displayed to the user.
- When the user clicks on the subscribe button, a success message will be displayed to the user.
- The component is responsive on different screen sizes.
- Replicates the Figma design copy excellently.

I enjoyed building this challenge.
